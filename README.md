# auto-fauet
Test cognitive image rendering to apply events to simple hardware.

"this means, for example, I could have that water tap make congnitive decisions, and importantly prototype the idea without cost."

The above statement is what brought this project about. The word `concept` is greatly related to this project. Its main aim to test the cognitive image recognition of [IBM Bluemix](https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net) using low level electronics that are available to `hacker spaces` and `maker movements`.

High costs could be involved as data would have to be streamed from the system to [Bluemix](https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net), therefore this is more a `watercooler` or `foo` project.

## Concept

 - camera streams to image recognition
 - faucet turns on if it can reasonably deduce user is picking up container for water or not.
